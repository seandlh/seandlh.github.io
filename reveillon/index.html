    Wikipedia says this about </a><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9veillon">Réveillon</a>: In Belgium, Brazil, France, Portugal, Romania, the province of Québec, many cities across Northern Ontario, the city of New Orleans,<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9veillon#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> and some other French-speakingplaces, a <i>réveillon</i> is a long dinner, and possibly a party, held on the evenings preceding Christmas Day and New Year's Day. The name of this dinner is based on the word <i>réveil</i> (meaning "waking"), because participation involves staying awake until midnight and beyond. In Portuguese-speaking countries, it is also a designation for the party preceding the New Year's Day. In the United States, the <i>réveillon</i> tradition is still observed in New Orleans due to the city's strong French heritage, with a number of the city's restaurants offering special <i>réveillon</i> menus on Christmas Eve.</em><br><br>
